<!-- The issue is that every assignment row is mapping over the same handledAssignments state, meaning every row gets the same set of buttons. This is why clicking one button affects all of them.

How to Fix It
Each assignment should have its own independent state for the "submitted," "downloaded," and "completed" buttons.

âœ… Steps to Fix:
Initialize handledAssignments with a unique state for each assignment

Update the state using assignment.id to change only the clicked assignment's status -->

ðŸ”‘ Whatâ€™s Fixed?
âœ… Each assignment now has its own unique state
âœ… Clicking a button only updates that assignmentâ€™s state
âœ… No more affecting all buttons at once ðŸŽ¯

Now, each button works independently per row! ðŸš€








<!-- You said:
Aaah fixed, thanks .Although I didn't quite understand where the problem was


ChatGPT said:
Glad you fixed it! ðŸŽ‰ The issue was with how you were mapping over handledAssignments inside the td for each row.

The Problem:
You were mapping over handledAssignments for every assignment row.

This means that for every assignment in isFiltered, all buttons were being repeated based on the structure of handledAssignments.

Thatâ€™s why clicking one button affected all buttonsâ€”it wasn't tied to the correct assignment.

The handledAssignments state was a static array with only one object (id: 1).

Since you werenâ€™t properly associating actions with the correct assignment, every button change affected the whole component.

The Fix:
You need to associate each assignmentâ€™s button state properly using the id from isFiltered (or assignmentsList).

Instead of looping over handledAssignments, ensure each assignment row gets its own state reference.

If you still need help understanding what went wrong, I can break it down further! ðŸš€







You said:
Make it easier for a person who does  not know coding


ChatGPT said:
Alright! Imagine you have a list of assignments, and each assignment has three buttons: Submit, Download, and Complete.

Now, let's say you want to click the "Submit" button for only one assignment. But instead, all the "Submit" buttons for all assignments change at the same time. That's the problem you were facing.

Why Did That Happen?
You had a separate list of button states, but it wasnâ€™t correctly linked to each assignment. So, when you clicked a button, the system thought you were changing the button for every assignment instead of just one.

The Fix
You made sure that each button is correctly tied to its specific assignment. Now, when you click "Submit" for Assignment 3, only that assignment's button changes, and the others stay the same.

It's like labeling each button with the right assignment so they don't all react at once! ðŸš€ -->
